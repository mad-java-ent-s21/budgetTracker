1. Difficulty figuring out many to one relationship using hibernate.

### 02/22/2021
1. Issue with pushing to github, I'm not sure what happened. I had to delete it and create a new version control and pull it back in. Had to re-write some code.
1. Pushed last weeks work to github.
1. Updated User table to include email.
1. Added some jsp files to the application, and a basic form for the index page.
1. Still working on many to one relationship hibernate.

I got a little set back with an issue pushing to github late into the weekend. I noticed that I did not push anything into
github for the past two weeks which I lost quite of bit of materials. I will be pushing more frequently now, lesson learned.

## Week 6
### 02/28/2021
1. Re-worked implementing Dao tests for all Daos.
   
### 03/01/2021
1. Finished all Dao tests. (May re-work it more, move to a generic Dao)
1. Checked and worked through log4j. Mostly finished implementing log4j.

This week was a lot of catch up to do, as last week, my whole project had to be deleted. I pulled what I had in github to help me produce what I have now.
Will still need to rework some things, such as move to a generic dao until I need a more complicated one.

## Week 7
### 03/02/2021
1. Updated weekly reflections to have complete reflections.
1. Updated directory to have designDocuments and journal to separate designs/plans and overall reflections/time logs.
