## Week 5
### 02/18/2021
1. Started database structure.
1. Created Category, Entry, User java files and dao files.
1. Difficulty figuring out many to one relationship using hibernate.

### 02/22/2021
1. Issue with pushing to github, I'm not sure what happened. I had to delete it and create a new version control and pull it back in. Had to re-write some code.
1. Pushed last weeks work to github.
1. Updated User table to include email.
1. Added some jsp files to the application, and a basic form for the index page.
1. Still working on many to one relationship hibernate.

I got a little set back with an issue pushing to github late into the weekend. I noticed that I did not push anything into
github for the past two weeks which I lost quite of bit of materials. I will be pushing more frequently now, lesson learned.

## Week 6
### 02/28/2021
1. Re-worked implementing Dao tests for all Daos.
   
### 03/01/2021
1. Finished all Dao tests. (May re-work it more, move to a generic Dao)
1. Checked and worked through log4j. Mostly finished implementing log4j.

This week was a lot of catch up to do, as last week, my whole project had to be deleted. I pulled what I had in github to help me produce what I have now.
Will still need to rework some things, such as move to a generic dao until I need a more complicated one.

## Week 7
### 03/02/2021
1. Updated weekly reflections to have complete reflections.
1. Updated directory to have designDocuments and journal to separate designs/plans and overall reflections/time logs.

### 03/07/2021
1. Added GenericDao, did not implement it yet.
1. Added admin directory with admin.jsp.
1. Added and implemented content.xml and web.xml for admin access.
1. Update to have admin roles and general roles in database.
1. Issues with figuring out tomcat@localhost to allow access for admins, error was in the 'granting' access to the correct db.
Used the wrong db (used the example one) when granting access.

## Week 8
### 03/23/2021
1. Struggled with api assignment, trying to figure out how to implement api. Figured out that I needed a key access to use the api.

## Week 9
### 03/28/2021
1. Figured out how to work the api for the assignment.

### 03/29/2021
1. Slowly piecing how the AWS was working. Halted due to inability to ssh into my instance.
1. Did something on AWS to make it work, not exactly sure.
1. Had issues with having some data displayed. Had to work around, figured out my data won't display locally, but will display on my AWS.
1. Finally, implemented my authentication into AWS version of my application.

### 03/30/2021
1. Solved my issue with mySQL not displaying data to my deployment. I asked for help in slack, and turns out to be time zone issue. Utilized other slack posts to figure out issue.
